Flutter Task: Build a Simple To-Do App

Description:
Create a simple To-Do app using Flutter. Users should be able to add tasks, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks.

Requirements:

    Use Flutter to build the app.
    Create a simple UI that allows users to:
        Add new tasks.
        View a list of tasks.
        Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
        Delete tasks from the list.
    Store tasks locally (you can use a package like shared_preferences or a simple JSON file).

Bonus:

    Add categories for tasks (e.g., Work, Personal).
    Implement task filtering (e.g., view only completed, incomplete, or all tasks).
    Add basic animations for task completion and deletion.
